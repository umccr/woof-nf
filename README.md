# woof-nf
`woof-nf` evaluates the concordance between genomic variants called from the same sample by
different methods. This tool is particularly useful for understanding the practical impacts of
changes and updates made to variant calling pipelines, and for detecting the introduction of
regressions.

The core logic of `woof-nf` has been ported from the [woof](https://github.com/pdiakumis/woof)
pipeline.

## Installation
Using Conda to install `woof-nf` is recommended. A [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/scwatts/woof-nf) is also available though it is primarily used for
AWS Batch execution. While possible to run `woof-nf` partially or entirely within the Docker
container locally, doing so is not fully supported.

### Conda
Simply create a new Conda environment and install `woof-nf`:
```bash
conda create \
  --prefix $(pwd -P)/conda_env/ \
  --channel scwatts \
  --channel pdiakumis \
  --channel bioconda \
  --channel conda-forge \
  --channel defaults \
  --yes \
  woof-nf
```

The `circos` Conda package is currently broken. To fix the install run:
```bash
# Activate
conda activate conda_env/
# Apply fix: GD and libwebp; Statistics::Basic (macOS only)
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]]; then
  ln -s ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libwebp.7.dylib ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libwebp.6.dylib
  conda install -y -c bioconda perl-app-cpanminus
  cpan Statistics::Basic
elif [ "$(expr substr $(uname -s) 1 5)" == "Linux" ]; then
  ln -s ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libwebp.so.7 ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libwebp.so.6
else
  echo "error: system appears to be unsupported, got $(uname) but expected Linux or Darwn" >&2
fi
```

### Requirements for AWS
There is an AWS plugin packaged with Nextflow that allows execution of tasks through AWS Batch. The
following AWS infrastructure are required:
1. Batch job queue,
2. Batch compute environment, and
3. Batch instance role

For specifics and example CloudFormation template see `infrastructure/aws_nextflow_batch.yaml`. Note
that the security groups and subnets referenced in this file are specific to the UMCCR AWS dev
account and are managed by Terraform.

Additionally, you will also need to install `aws-cli`. This can be obtained through Conda or
[installed manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

## Usage
Execute and run jobs locally:
```bash
./woof_nf-runner.py \
  --run_dir_one data/first_set/ \
  --run_dir_two data/second_set/ \
  --output_dir output/
```

Execute locally, run jobs on AWS (`--s3_bucket` specifies bucket and directory for intermediate result files):
```bash
./woof_nf-runner.py \
  --run_dir_one data/first_set/ \
  --run_dir_two data/second_set/ \
  --output_dir output/ \
  --executor aws \
  --s3_bucket s3://bucket-name/object-key/
```

Execute locally, run jobs on AWS with S3 inputs (inputs staged directly from S3 to appropriate AWS instance during job execution):
```bash
./woof_nf-runner.py \
  --run_dir_one s3://bucket-name/first_set/ \
  --run_dir_two s3://bucket-name/second_set/ \
  --output_dir output/ \
  --executor aws \
  --s3_bucket s3://bucket-name/temp/
```

Note that AWS configuration is currently hard coded in `woof_nf/aws.py`.

## Outputs
The `woof-nf` output directory contains:
* a report detailing results (`report.html`),
* individual directories for sample outputs (further details below),
* the pipeline log (`pipeline_log.txt`),
* a copy of the pipeline configuration (`nextflow.config`), and
* the list of input files (`input_files`)

Here is the directory structure of an example output:
```text
output/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2016_249_17_MH_P033__CCR170115b_MH17T002P033/
â”œâ”€â”€ B_ALL_Case_10__MDX190025_B_ALL_Case_10T/
â”œâ”€â”€ COLO829_1__Colo829/
â”œâ”€â”€ COLO829_2__Colo829_60pc/
â”œâ”€â”€ CUP-Pairs8__PRJ180660_8_DNA009529_FFPE/
â”œâ”€â”€ SEQC-II-50pc__SEQC-II_Tumor_50pc/
â”œâ”€â”€ SFRC01073__PRJ180598_SFRC01073-S2T/
â”œâ”€â”€ input_files.tsv
â”œâ”€â”€ nextflow.config
â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline_log.txt
â””â”€â”€ report.html
```

Each sample directory contains three subdirectories, and you can find data presented in the
`report.html` file in the appropriate sample subdirectory. Here is the directory structure of one
sample from the example output:
```text
output/COLO829_1__Colo829/
â”œâ”€â”€ copy_number_variants
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cn_diff.tsv
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ cn_diff_coord.tsv
â”œâ”€â”€ small_variants
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 1_filtered_vcfs/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 2_variants_intersect/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 3_comparison/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ counts.tsv
â””â”€â”€ structural_variants
    â”œâ”€â”€ circos/
    â”œâ”€â”€ eval_metrics.tsv
    â””â”€â”€ fpfn.tsv
```
